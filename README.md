# esx_pickweed
This script uses a prop cache instead of coordinates to enable "pickable" marijuana around San Andreas. Requires ESX framework and "weed" item in the database.

I am not maintaining this script or providing direct support for it, you can reply in the forum thread or create a issue/PR and I will address at my next best conveinence.


# Operation:
1. Create "weed" item in your database items table.
2. Add "esx_pickweed" to your server.cfg
3. Head to any location with weed props and pick your plants!
4. For additional use of the script we reccomend using: https://forum.fivem.net/t/esx-sell-drugs-to-npcs-weed-only/89355
